#How to Turn in Assignments

##Before you can turn in an assignment:
1. Create an ECST account accounts.ecst.csuchico.edu.
2. Create a class account turnin.ecst.csuchico.edu.
3. Log into your turnin.ecst.csuchico.edu account
4. Select the current semester at the bottom of your homepage
5. Select the class and press the "Enroll in Selected Course" button

##For each assignment you want to turn in:
1. Press the "Submit Assignment" button for the assignment you want to submit.
2. Upload the required files using the "Browse..." button.
3. Press the "Submit Assignment" button.  This may take several seconds.
4. If the instructor has provided a Makefile, your program will be compiled.  Check that your program compiled there were no errors in the "Make Error Output" box.
5. If the instructor provided tests, your program will be tested.  Check that your program passed all the tests.  As of January 2015, you cannot view the tests on turnin, check your course webpage or talk to your instructor.
6. If there were any compilation or testing errors fix your assignment and resubmit it.

##Problems

If there is a problem with the turn in system, e-mail your program to your instructor as attachments avoid zip and gzip files because they are usually deleted by the University mail system..  The time your e-mail arrives will be used as the submission time.  Some e-mail providers such as hotmail. can take many hours to deliver mail.  It is best to use your official University mail account or another gmail account.

##Late Assignments:

If an instructor allows you to turn an assignment in late, a late deadline will be listed next to the assignment on your turnin page.

Check the course syllabus for your instructor's late policy.
